    I am a Scientist in Raytheon BBN Technology and an Associate of Physics Department at Harvard University. My research focuses on understanding the strongly interacting many-body phenomena and mesoscopic physics in quantum materials, and their applications to novel, high-sensitivity quantum detectors and quantum information science. Specifically, I am interested in (1) how the new paradigm of the electronic hydrodynamics modifies our conventional understandings of the electrical and thermal transport properties in condensed matter physics, and (2) its deep connection to the fundamental physics such as the chiral anomaly, anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) bound, and quark-gluon plasma in the heavy ion collider. The material platforms of these experiments include, but not limited to, graphene, two-dimensional Van der Waals heterostructures, Dirac and Weyl semimetals, and topological materials. A prime example along this direction is my experiment demonstrating the breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law in graphene as the hydrodynamic Dirac fluid forms near the Dirac point. To overcome the experimental challenges, I have been developing the state-of-the-art measurement techniques to observe the phenomena in this new hydrodynamic regime. Understanding the quantum many-body systems can lead to new (3) quantum sensor applications, such as the graphene-based Josephson junction single photon detector for quantum computations, optics, and radioastronomy, (4) novel two-dimensional materials-based superconducting quantum devices, as well as (5) dark matter axion detection.  It has been my privilege to collaborate with many outstanding scientists. The interaction with them has inspired a lot of my research and makes my professional life colorful in many ways. I am grateful for the funding supports from ARO, NSA, and Raytheon BBN Technologies.
